### **Correct Answer:**
- **A) It appends the output of a command to a file, without overwriting the existing content.**

### **Explanation of Each Option:**

- **A) It appends the output of a command to a file, without overwriting the existing content.**
   - This is the correct answer. The `>>` operator in Unix is used to append the output of a command to a file. If the file already contains some content, this operator adds the new output at the end of the file without deleting or overwriting the existing data.

- **B) It creates a new file and writes the output of a command into it, overwriting any existing content.**
   - This is incorrect. The `>` operator, not `>>`, is used for this. The `>` operator creates a new file or overwrites an existing file with the output of a command.

- **C) It reads the content from a file and sends it as input to a command.**
   - This is incorrect. The `<` operator is used to read input from a file and send it to a command, not `>>`.

- **D) It compares two files and displays the differences.**
   - This is incorrect. The `diff` command is used for comparing two files and showing differences, not `>>`.
