### MCQ: Which command is used to delete a directory in UNIX?

**Question:**  
Which of the following commands is used to delete a directory in UNIX?

- A) `rm -r`
- B) `rmdir`
- C) `rm -f`
- D) `del`

#### Correct Answer:
**A) `rm -r`**

#### Explanation:

- **A) `rm -r`**  
  This is the correct option. The `rm -r` command deletes a directory and all its contents recursively. It is used when you want to remove a directory and everything inside it (files, subdirectories).

- **B) `rmdir`  
  This command removes an empty directory. If the directory contains files or subdirectories, it will not work.

- **C) `rm -f`  
  The `rm -f` command forces the removal of files without prompting for confirmation but does not work for directories unless used with the `-r` option.

- **D) `del`  
  This command is used in Windows, not UNIX. It is not valid for deleting directories in UNIX.
